PIPduino
========

A 'duino clone you can Put In a Project. Small, breadboard-friendly 'duinos are compact and work
great on a breadboard. But you need a baseboard to embed them in a project.

PIPduino already has ports for I2C, SPI, Serial/FTDI, and servo-style connectors with VCC and GND
for each analog and digital pin.  It has a beefy regulator on board, too.

Soon available for sale on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/bot_thoughts/).
